L#00 -- But What Does the Data Say?

Ricky Lin, Bo Hui Lu, Susan Lin

## Hypothesis ## 
As the size of the matrix, n, increases the runtime will increase at a linear rate.

## Background: The Big Oh ##
MatrixFinder.java should have a runtime of O(n).  

## Methodology (repeat for increasing sample size) ##
-Using the same sample size, run 10 trials (loop 100000000x), but randomize the elements. Check the runtime of those trials and document it in a .csv file.

## Results ## 

## Conclusions ##
