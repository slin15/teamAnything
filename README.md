#Hypothesis: As the size of the matrix, n, increases the runtime will increase at a linear rate.

#Background: The Big Oh
##MatrixFinder.java should have a runtime of O(n).  

#Methodology (repeat for increasing sample size):
##-Using the same sample size, run 10 trials (loop 100000000x), but randomize the elements. Check the runtime of those trials and document it in a .csv file.

#Results:

#Conclusions:
